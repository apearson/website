	<dt><h2>Who am I?</h2></dt>
	<dd>
		I am a Software Developer specialized in web technologies and computer networks. I have over 5 years of experience in web development using the latest technology while maintaining compatibility with older systems.<br/><br/>
		I studied Computer Science at The University of Alabama at Birmingham. While there I acted as the chair for the local Association of Computing Machinery and as acting chair developed the chapterâ€™s membership from 15 members to over 50 members. In previous positions I also developed applications using the latest technologies to retrieve data from remote device monitors and secure that data during both transit and while at rest.<br/><br/>
		In my free time, I work on projects ranging from home automation to core internet technologies.
